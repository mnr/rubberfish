## Embedding a Raspberry Pi into a Big Mouth Billy Bass

Before you read any further, it's important to review this excellent write-up titled [Installing Linux on a Dead Badger: User's Notes](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/installing-linux-on-a-dead-badger-users-notes/) by Lucy A. Snyder. If I am asked, I will name this as the source of my inspiration.

*The Truth ... I was well into my fish conversion before my friend [David D. Levine](http://www.daviddlevine.com/) pointed out this article.*

This github project documents my progress on connecting a raspberry pi to a [Big Mouth Billy Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_Billy_Bass).

## Problems I've solved

### How to access and drive the fish motors

### How to supply power

### How to sync mouth movements to audio

### How to convert text to speech

### How to control the front panel meter

### How to read the front panel switches

### How to reduce audio noise

### Electrical connections between the fish and the RPi
