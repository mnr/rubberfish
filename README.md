## Embedding a Raspberry Pi into a Big Mouth Billy Bass

Before you read any further, it's important to review this excellent write-up titled [Installing Linux on a Dead Badger: User's Notes](http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/installing-linux-on-a-dead-badger-users-notes/) by Lucy A. Snyder. If I am asked, I will name this as the source of my inspiration.

*The Truth ... I was well into my fish conversion before my friend [David D. Levine](http://www.daviddlevine.com/) pointed out this article.*

This github project documents my progress on connecting a raspberry pi to a [Big Mouth Billy Bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mouth_Billy_Bass).

## Other Bass Masters
* In 2009, [Steve Ravet](http://mbed.org/cookbook/Big-Mouth-Billy-Bass) connected an ARM mbed to Billy.
* In 2016, [Brian Kane connected a fish to Amazon Alexa](https://www.facebook.com/hdadd/videos/10157576067105265/).
* In 2017, [Mike McGurrin and the Yorick Project](https://www.hackster.io/mike-mcgurrin/the-yorick-project-f9bac7)

## Narrative
I've updated [the wiki](https://github.com/mnr/rubberfish/wiki) with progress on the fish.
