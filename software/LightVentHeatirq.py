phraseToSay_one = """What kind of clothes would they wear,
the little fishes of the lake?
Would they collect tiny pebbles in their pockets
or carry extra scales for when their own float off?
Would the big ones strap on large, artificial fins
to play shark games along the shore?
Would they wear mittens to ward off winterâ€™s chill,
and ball caps to block the summer sun?
Would they be modest? Would they be vain?
Would they admire the fishery tags and hope
to one day score a piercing of their own?
Would they worry that their tails are looking fat?"""

phraseToSay_two = """Do fish tell
abduction stories, huddled
around in conference rooms
of run-down hotels
or in the calm eddies of
lesser-known riverbanks
recounting the horrific tales
of laying on dry rocks, being
probed in the gills,
and passing out?
And having nothing more
than their hazy dusk
memories,
do they wonder if maybe
five-fingered mammals
don't really exist?"""
